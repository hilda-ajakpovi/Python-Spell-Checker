# Python-Spell-Checker
This program spell checks every word in a given input based on a standard dictionary or a given dictionary
Workflow for interface:
- Allow user to upload their own dictionary or use standard one
- User decides if they want to upload a file or type in something to spell check.
- The program will parse the string and spell check each word and return how many spelling errors that there are.
- The user will then be prompted to either fix all errors with the number one suggested word for each mispelled word, select a word to see suggested words and have the option to replace and then loop through the words (either going forward or backwards) to see suggested words for those words and possibly replace. For every mispelled word, the user is also allowed to add the word to the dictionary for future use.
- The user can also start from the first word for the loop.
- Once user is done with this string (If file, the user will have an option to write the edited input back to the file), they can either do this again with a new file/input or quit the program.
